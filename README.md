# C++ Fundamentals

This collection of materials is dedicated to exploring idiomatic modern C++ design. Each topic contains a mixture of code samples and example programs to demonstrate common usage, along with references and links to external resources where applicable. Originally conceived in June 2023, this repository is intended to be a living document, continually updated to accommodate new research and language features as they become available.

## Audience

The material is intended for early career engineers, developers new to the C++ language, or folks working in a research-focused role where C++ is the primary tool of use. In no way is this intended to be a comprehensive overview of the language and its numerous features. Rather, it aims to serve as an introduction to many common use cases, adhering to widely accepted best practices throughout.
