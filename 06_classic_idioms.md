# Classic Idioms

A programming idiom is a common and recognizable pattern of code or technique used to solve specific problems in software development. It represents a concise and effective way of expressing a solution within the context of a particular programming language or paradigm. Idioms often improve code readability, maintainability, and performance.

The idioms herein are a mixture of refinements to well-known and widely used design patterns and specific applications of core language and standard library features. Each idiom codifies decades of existing practice, and has existed in recognizable form since the turn of the century.
